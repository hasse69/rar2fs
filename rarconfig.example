# Syntax:
#
# [<archive>|</some/dir/archive>]
# 	seek-length = <n>
# 	password = "<password>"
# 	save-eof = [true|false]
#       alias = <"filename","alias">
#
# The optional path format of the archive specifier is an absolute path
# relative to the mount point root and not the soutce folder. For volumes
# the archive name must be that of the first file in the set
#
# An 'alias' entry must always start with a '/' since it is expressed as an
# absolute path relative to the root of the archive.
# The use of 'alias' is only supported for files, not directories.
#
# A setting specified here will always override whatever was specified
# (or not specified) as the mount option default on the command line.
#

# Example archive #1 (no password, alias)
#[example1.rar]
#	# Set seek length to 10
#	seek-length = 10
#	alias = "/original_name","/alias_name"

# Example archive #2 (default seek length, password)
#[example2.rar]
#	# Set password
#	password = "secret"
