        * Release v1.27.0

        * dirname() do not modify passed string on some platforms (#93)

        * Fix build issue with C++14

        The C++11 warning "invalid suffix on literal" was reported in issue #48
        but for some reason the resulting patch did not correct all the offending
        places in the code.

        This patch should resolve issue #87.

        * Add option to set file date according to main archive file

        This patch adds the '--date-rar' option that be be used to force file
        dates/timestamps to be set according to the main archive file instead
        of the meta data. See feature request #86.

        * Fix scandir(3) argument detection

        The configure script is trying to detect type of third argument
        to scandir(3). The detection fails on systems that enable non-null
        argument checks. This patch changes the arguments fed to scandir(3)
        by the m4 macro to make sure non-null checks do not trigger.

        This patch should resolve issue #85.

2017-10-24  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Release v1.26.0

        * Fix some compilation problems on OSX Sierra

        This patch should resolve some compilation errors/warnings on
        Sierra 10.2 platforms as reported in issue #83.

        * Fix an issue with file mounts and root folder lookup

        This patch should resolve issue #80.

        * Fix check for dokan-fuse library

        The name of the dokan-fuse library is libdokanfuse1.dll.a and the
        configuration is searching for libcygdokanfuse1.a.
        Use the name from the latest Dokany v1.0.3 release.
        This problem was discovered while investigating issue #82.

        * Workaround for misbehaving pread(2) on Cygwin

        At EOF pread(2) should return 0 but on Cygwin that is not the case
        and instead some very high number is observed like 1628127168.

        From the pread(2) man page:
          "On success, the number of bytes read or written is returned
          (zero indicates that nothing was written, in the case of pwrite(),
          or end of file, in the case of pread()), or -1 on error, in which
          case errno is set to indicate the error."

        Let's assume that if what is returned from pread(2) is greater than
        the requested read size, EOF has been reached.
        Without this workaround at least dokan-fuse gets very confused and
        is caught in an infinite loop!

        * Fix Incorrect high-precision timestamp

        From libunrar v5.5.x high-precision timestamp API is changed,
        from GetRaw() to GetUnixNS(). GetRaw() provides Windows FILETIME
        value that is a 100 ns unit timestamp from 1601-01-01. GetUnixNS()
        provides a Unix high-precision timestamp, which has 1 ns unit
        counting from 1970-01-01. Current rar2fs behavior with libunrar
        v5.5.x is wrong, treating 1 ns unit timestamp as 100 ns as reported
        in issue #79.

        Thanks to jyhpsycho for the original patch.

2017-06-18  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Release v1.25.2

        * Fix wrong volume count logic

        The volume count logic is broken for new style volumes resulting in
        input/output errors at access. This patch will fix that and solve
        the problem reported in issue #77.

2017-06-14  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Release v1.25.1

        * Fix parse problem for file header flags

        When moving over to definitions from unrarsrc rather than using
        internal hard-coded values, files started to show up as directories
        instead of regular files as reported in issue #76. By accident this
        worked before this change but the implementation was actually broken
        even before that.
        This patch fixes the incorrect header parser in a backwards compatible
        way to work seamlessly also for earlier versions of unrarsrc.

2017-06-10  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Release v1.25.0

        * Rename IO buffer API

        * Remove block device macros

        * Use proper definitions from libunrar headers

        Many definitions are hidden and supposed to be used only internally
        within the library itself, some of those having the same value(s)
        as the public exported interface. Later version of the library will
        properly export all public definitions instead of using magic constants.
        This patch will prepare for those definitions by using them in the way
        they were intended to be used. For backwards compatibility the
        definitions are also added to the library extension if not already
        defined. This patch also improves the presentation of volumes that are
        missing or having corrupt key parts.

        * Relax read restrictions in raw mode

        In raw mode any type of read error can be made more relaxed
        returning bogus data in the buffer (0) instead of error.
        This patch should address the enhancement request reported
        in issue #52 for RAR archives in store mode.

        * Remove workaround for fuse_exited() on CYGFUSE

        The latest version of CYGFUSE now supports fuse_exited()
        so a workaround is no longer needed.

        * Allow --VolumePrefix=UNC to be passed to WinFSP

        * Add build support for Dokany+dokanfuse

        * Update detection for visibility attribute support

        * Fix issue with SIGTERM not always working when daemonized

        The function fuse_set_signal_handlers() is called before calling
        fuse_daemonize(). This has some effect on signal processing that
        on CYGWIN causes the SIGTERM signal to not be delivered when
        issuing e.g. the 'kill' command on a daemonized rar2fs process.
        This patch changes the order in which these two functions are
        called.

        * Remove target folder check for cygwin

        * Add support for WinFSP/cygfuse layer

        This patch provides the necessary build support for the
        WinFSP/cygfuse layer to allow rar2fs to be run under Windows
        as requested in issue #75.

        * Add error checks before calling creat(2)

        Error checks were made after creat(2) was called resulting
        in files possibly being created (by e.g. touch) erroneously.
        This patch makes sure any internal error checks are performed
        before creat(2) or open(2) is called.

        This patch also includes some minor cleanup in the raw read
        service function(s) and removal of unused bit fields.

        * Change 'RARVolNameToFirstName' fix for .NNN files

        * Simplify volume check logic

        This patch simplifies the volume check logic and also corrects
        a couple of rare corner cases.

        * Add per archive configuration

        This patch implements both part 1 and 2 of the feature request
        reported in issue #60.

          libunrar versions prior to 4.2.0.

        * Fixed a potential memory leak in the collect_files()

2014-07-16  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Changed implementation of utimens

        * [rar2fs #35]

2014-03-19  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Released 1.20.0

        * Turned off support for block special device mounts other
          than for Linux platforms. It does not make much sense trying  
          to support it any where else due to possible read alignment
          restrictions.

2014-03-18  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Built and tested against UnRAR source 5.10 beta 1 (5.1.1)

2014-03-17  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * [rar2fs #34]

        Fixed a problem with old style archives split into more
        than 101 files.

2014-03-16  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Now returning "No such file or directory" instead of
          "Input/output error" when trying to read information
          for a file outside an archive or which does not exist
          at all (libunrar5 only).

        * Fixed an issue when retrieving file information (#info)
          that could have resulted in an infinite loop.

        * Fixed an issue with resolving symbolic links for
          legacy archives in combination with libunrar5.

2014-03-08  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Corrected some issues that caused compilation failures
          for UnRAR source 4.1.x.

2014-03-07  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Corrected a problem seen on e.g. FreeBSD for which closedir()
          was called with a NULL pointer resulting in a crash.

2014-03-06  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * [rar2fs #31]

        Corrected some compilation errors on FreeBSD (and also other
        platforms that sets HAVE_SETXATTR).

2014-03-02  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Mounting block special files on Linux can now benefit from
          fmemopen() when supported.

2014-02-25  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Enabled syslog support

2014-02-24  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * [rar2fs #22]
           
          Now may fall back to the old workaround from 1.19.2 that 
          should be working also for (some!?) uClibc versions of 
          fmemopen().

2014-02-23  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Corrected some additional problems with the solution
          for issue #22.

        * Added support for presenting high-resolution time stamp in 
          RAR5 archives (thanks to jyhpsycho for the initial patch).
          Legacy archives still require a new version of UnRAR source 
          before it can be enabled.

2014-02-23  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * [rar2fs #28]

          Fixed problem with mounting a block special file that 
          resulted in a crash due to incorrect use of mmap() and
          fmemopen().

2014-02-21  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added a missing check for errors from fmemopen() 

2014-02-21  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * [rar2fs #29]

          Fixed a minor calculation error in the file time stamp
          'seconds' part as provided by libunrar (MS-DOS time format).

        * Removed 'INSTALL' from SVN trunk

2014-02-14  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Released 1.19.8

2014-02-07  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Disabled automatic switch to direct I/O mode.

        * Tweaked some of the more fine grained "hacks" to improve
          support for compressed archives.

        * Now supports 'flag_nullpath_ok' and 'flag_nopath'
          (FUSE >= 2.9) in fuse ops.

2014-02-04  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * The race condition in the I/O buffer has been identified and
          the lock utilization has been redesigned accordingly to
          minimize lock contention.

        * Added check for __sync_synchronize()

2014-02-03  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Changed use of the FUSE 'keep_cache' flag

        * Removed the attempt to optimize the lock contention level
          in the I/O buffer. Seems to have opened up for additional 
          race conditions. When CPU is really needed lock contention
          should be close to none anyway.

2014-02-02  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Released 1.19.5

2014-02-01  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * [rar2fs #27]

          Fixed a problem with seek length not being handled properly
          when mounting a single archive split into volumes.

2014-01-31  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * [rar2fs #25]

          Added some mutex locks to take care of the race conditions
          that were discovered in the I/O buffer.

2014-01-29  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * [rar2fs #24]

          Added support for the 'Save identical file as references'
          feature in RAR5 archives.

2014-01-28  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Released 1.19.2

        * [rar2fs #22]

          The fix for this issue (released in 1.19.1) did not
          work properly for RAR5 archives.

2014-01-14  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Released 1.19.1
       
        * [rar2fs #22]

          Corrected an issue with "RAR inside RAR" in combination
          with libunrar5 and lack of support for fmemopen()
          (common for e.g. many uClibc based systems).

2014-01-13  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Validation of UnRAR source version did not work
          as expected.

2014-01-06  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Released 1.19.0

2013-11-11  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * [rar2fs #20]

          Corrected some issues in configure.ac since it failed to
          properly configure the package for static linkage.

2013-11-04  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * [rar2fs #19]

          Added a missing close of the handle obtained when mounting an
          archive instead of a directory. Besides the fact that it should
          not be left open, it seems to have also affected the behavior of
          libunrar for RAR5 archives in such a way that the extraction 
          process stopped working completely.

2013-10-26  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Now using PRIu64 (C99) when printing 64-bit values 

2013-10-18  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed an error that caused failures to recognize the 
          option '--iob-size'.

2013-10-18  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Redesigned handling of encrypted archives completely.
          Now using UnRAR library callback API to set password.

        * A password can now be provided in wide-character format.

        * Password files may now be prefixed with a '.' to hide it
          from simple list operations in traditional UNIX style.
          rar2fs(1) man page updated accordingly.
          
        * Trying to access a file that is encrypted and for which
          no valid password is provided will give EPERM.

        * Removed option '--no-passwd' since there is no 
          longer a small performance penalty involved by having
          this support enabled for non-encrypted archives.
          This option was removed from the rar2fs(1) man page
          since long time back.

        * Now taking better use of the provided methods
          in UnRAR library API when listing archives.

        * Minor improvements in the handling of old style
          (.rNN) volumes.
           
2013-10-10  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * [rar2fs #17]

          Corrected a problem with password protected archives that
          resulted in a crash when files were encrypted but file names
          were not.

2013-09-25  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Released 1.18.0

        * Fixed a problem seen on eg. Debian 3.1 for which
          fuse_main() crashed when called with a NULL
          pointer instead of a valid fuse_operations struct.

2013-09-18  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added a second mount attempt in case fuse is throwing
          an error due to missing support for option -osubtype. 
          The second time the mount is attempted without the
          option added internally.
        
2013-09-18  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Corrected a version check error resulting in a 
          crash when trying to run a rar2fs version compiled
          using UnRAR source 5.0.11 or later.

2013-09-18  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Replacing -Wextra with the deprecated -W for old
          versions of gcc

2013-09-17  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added check for existence of function fuse_version()

        * Added check for -Wextra support by compiler

2013-09-14  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added proper check if back-trace functions are 
          provided as a separate library. Lack of this check
          resulted in build failures on FreeBSD.

2013-09-04  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a broken version check for the official release
          (non beta) of UnRAR source 5.0.x.

2013-08-10  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a time (DST) calculation bug

        * Replaced the Unicode to/from UTF-8 translation 
          function(s)

        * Prepared the code for using iconv.
          Currently not enabled. Not sure it will ever be.

        * Deleted file(s): utf8.h, utf8.c 

2013-08-08  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a bug when identifying host OS for
          RAR5 archives.

        * Minor code clean-up and bug fixes in the 
          DLL extensions for RAR5 archives.
          
2013-08-07  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Updated old build support files

        * Prepared the build environment for detecting the
          availability of iconv. Once in place it should 
          most likely replace the current UTF-8 conversion
          routine.

        * Externally filesystem entries are now being
          translated to UTF-8 irrespective of what current
          process locale is set to. Internally Unicode is 
          still used when applicable.

        * New file(s): utf8.h, utf8.c

2013-08-06  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a small bug that resulted in a stale
          mount point even if a mount option was not
          actually accepted.

        * Added support for UNIX style symbolic links in
          RAR5 archives (EXPERIMENTAL). 

2013-08-05  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added support for UNIX style symbolic links in
          RAR4 (and earlier) archives. RAR5 support still
          needs some further investigation.

2013-08-05  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed an error in configure.ac when resolving
          git HEAD that resulted in build failures.

2013-08-04  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added a new feature that allows presentation of file
          information inside RAR archives in technical format 
          (similar to 'unrar lt'). Eg. if there is a file named
          'foobar' inside an archive it can be listed using 
          'cat foobar#info'. This is a replacement for both the
          hard link count hack (compression method) *and* extended 
          attributes. Both which are still available when ever
          applicable. 

          Note that this new feature is included only when 
          compiled/linked towards UnRAR source v5.x.x or later.

        * Fixed a minor bug in the extended attributes that caused
          wrong compression method to be presented for 
          "rar inside rar" files.

        * Fixed a problem with MAP_FAILED not being defined if
          mmap(2) is not supported (very rare).

2013-07-29  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added compression method as an extended attribute
          (plus a few more for debug purposes).
          For systems that does not provide the extended
          attribute (xattr) system calls, compression method
          is still provided as the hard link count of regular
          files.

2013-07-28  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added support for creating symbolic links.

        * Fixed an old bug that allowed files on the underlying
          file system to be moved/renamed and potentially 
          "hiding" files inside RAR archives.

2013-07-03  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Released 1.17.2

2013-06-26  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Updated SVN revision check in configure.ac to work
          also for later versions of svn for which 
          .svn/entries does not provide sufficient information.

2013-06-24  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a problem in configure.ac that would result
          in newer versions of g++ to fail some link tests.
          This would in turn cause incorrect switches to be
          passed to the compiler resulting in failure to 
          display RAR archive/folder contents in combination
          with UnRAR source v5.x.x.

2013-06-05  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a potential bug when determining file types.
          Only affects RAR5 archives created on UNIX type
          systems.

2013-05-26  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Released 1.17.0

2013-05-21  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Built and tested against UnRAR source v5.0.4

2013-05-16  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed broken pre-open logic

        * Updated the pre-open logic to better handle RAR5

        * Minor code re-structuring

2013-05-10  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added full support for RAR1.5 format.
        
        * Minor code clean-up 

2013-05-09  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added creation of $(DESTDIR)/$(sbindir) in 
          Makefile.am before attempting to install the
          mount helper utility soft-link. 
          Thanks to ssuominen for the patch. 
        
        * Fixed a memory corruption bug when using libunrar5
          in combination with volume name lookup causing 
          intermittent crashes.
          
2013-05-08  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Replaced RAR_EXTRACT with RAR_TEST in calls to
          RARProcessFile(). The wrong behavior when using
          RAR_TEST has been fixed in UnRAR source v5.0.2.

        * Added a missing call to RARFreeArchive()

2013-05-08  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Removed an incorrect assert()

        * Fixed a compilation problem introduced in last version
          for UnRAR source releases earlier than v5.0.x

2013-05-07  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a bug in the volume file number and offset 
          calculation for RAR5 archives in store mode.

2013-05-06  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Built and tested against UnRAR source v5.0.2.
          This update requires a new invocation of autoreconf 
          to properly update the configure script and Makefile(s).
          This should resolve issue #14.
   
        * Fixed a few issues with "rar inside rar" that could
          have resulted in some files not being detected properly.

        * Removed some code from the unrar library extension
          that was no longer needed.
          
2013-04-16  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a minor compilation warning discovered on a 
          SLED 11 64-bit platform.

        * Added improved detection of corrupt RAR file headers.
          This should resolve issue #13.

2013-04-12  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added extraction of git commit hash when cloned
          from github.com (requires autoreconf)
        
        * Split of FUSE functions 

2013-04-12  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Replaced the deprecated AM_CONFIG_HEADER with
          AC_CONFIG_HEADERS in configure.ac

2013-03-17  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Second try to correct the Makefile.am error as reported
          in issue #12.

2013-03-13  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added an un-install hook in Makefile.am to make sure
          also the mount helper/script is removed when doing
          "make un-install".

2013-03-13  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Corrected an error in the install hook in Makefile.am.
          This should resolve issue #12.

2013-03-12  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Improved the file extension matching that is now
          less case sensitive.

2013-03-02  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed an issue with some archives that contained
          digits in the name were incorrectly identified as
          being part of a volume.

2013-02-23  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Released 1.16.0

2013-02-17  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added option '--flat-only' that replaces the now 
          obsoleted option '--seek-depth=n'
          rar2fs(1) man page updated accordingly.

2013-02-16  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a problem with some options not being possible
          to change if initially assigned a default value.

        * Changed to use a fixed file count for '--preopen-img'
          in combination with old style volume naming convention.

2013-02-08  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added option '--no-expand-cbr' that can be used
          to disable support for comic book archives.
          rar2fs(1) man page updated accordingly.

        * Removed option '--no-idx-mmap'. 
          rar2fs(1) man page updated accordingly.

2013-02-08  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added support for comic book archives (.cbr)

2013-02-07  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a problem with folders inside RAR volumes
          not always showing up properly.

2013-02-05  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added a few missing error checks after calls
          made to malloc()

        * Fixed a concurrency problem that theoretically
          could result in a crash if a file cache entry
          is invalidated while being accessed by e.g. 
          read operations.

2013-02-04  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed an issue for "rar inside rar" with 
          folders when located in the root of the
          mount point.

2013-02-04  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Removed hard link count update. It did not
          work as expected in some cases.

2013-02-03  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Hard link count now properly updated for 
          directories inside RAR files.

        * Fixed a bug in the cache invalidation logic
          that could result in memory leaks.

        * Improved cache lookup to make better use of
          the full 32-bit hash in order to avoid
          unnecessary calls to strcmp() when searching
          a hash collision chain.

2013-02-01  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Replaced 'configdb' with a more appropriate
          implementation

        * New file(s): optdb.h, optdb.c
          Deleted file(s): configdb.h, configdb.c

2013-01-31  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Removed workaround for zombie processes since 
          waitpid() should now be called properly

        * Aligned DLL extension with later implementations
          of libunrar.

2013-01-30  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Removed the limitation that main archive must
          not be a volume when encapsulating other RAR
          files for proper display/extraction.

2013-01-28  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Replaced a call to strncmp() with an inline short
          byte sequence check.

2013-01-28  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Got rid of some more unnecessary calls to
          strlen() and strcmp()

2013-01-28  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added proper implementation of utimes()

2013-01-27  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a very rare error case to prevent a lock-up
           
        * Removed a few more calls to strcmp()

2013-01-25  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Improved support for folders located in leaf RAR
          files contained in a master archive.
          This will also solve the problem reported in
          issue #11.

        * Fixed a crash (SEGV) when invalidating the entire 
          file cache.

        * Went back to use the classic zombie prevention 
          method by using SA_NOCLDWAIT when setting up the
          signal handler for SIGCHLD. 

        * File type detection in scandir() improved to reduce 
          the already low probability of ambiguous entries
          even further. Still there is not a 100% guarantee,
          but very close.

        * Optimizations in the folder processing by removing
          some extraneous calls to strlen()/strdup() etc.

        * Fixed an issue when the root folder entry was
          located in the end of the archive header.
          Forced stats were applied when in fact it should
          have been taken from the archive itself.

        * Now also umask is applied when forced directory
          entries are added to the cache.

        * When mounting archives the file cache is now
          populated in advance. Before this change it was
          possible to get a false "No such file or directory"
          error if the mounted folder was not listed first
          (using eg. ls).

        * When mounting an archive a missing release of some
          resources has been added when the file system is
          terminated. This was not a true memory leak but tools
          like valgrind could complain.

        * Now returns -EPERM instead of -EACCES in case of
          write operations targeting the contents of an archive.

2013-01-21  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a problem with function fmemopen() not being
          detected properly on systems supporting it.
          The change will not take effect until 'autoreconf'
          is executed before a 'configure' and/or 'make'.

2013-01-10  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a fuse4x detection problem in the compatible
          build system.

        * Added support for OSX fuse in the compatible 
          build system.

2013-01-09  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * When default permission is applied to a file or 
          directory also the current effective umask of the
          process will be considered. If the umask can not 
          be determined 0022 will be used.
          The default permission is applied only if the archive
          file header does not provide a Unix-style file mode. 

2013-01-08  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added blunt support for unicode filenames

          make sure a safe string copy is provided.

        * Removed some usage of alloca()

2012-03-31  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>
 
        * Added use of a hash instead of string comparison to
          improve performance of readdir() calls.

        * Code clean-up

        * New file(s): dirlist.c, hash.h

2012-03-16  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed some OpenSolaris build errors

2012-03-16  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Released 1.14.6

        * Fixed some bugs that could result in read buffer
          not being filled correctly for compressed archives.

        * History buffer should now be preserved when large
          forward jumps are made in the stream.

2012-03-06  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Released 1.14.5

        * Fixed yet another calculation bug in the exception
          path when dealing with the history buffer.

        * Added hiding of mount point in case of a file system
          loop (recursive mount).

        * Completed the xattr suit of functions.
          Also changed to no longer follow symbolic links.

2012-02-24  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * When a .r2i file is successfully loaded any direct I/O
          information is now purged from the cache. It might 
          still not take effect immediately depending on how the
          client internal cache is handled. 
 
2012-02-24  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a serious calculation error in one of the
          paths dealing with compressed RARs.

2012-02-23  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Changed return from xattr functions from ENODATA 
          to ENOTSUP for files inside RAR archives.
 
2012-02-23  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed an issue with 'echo' in get-version.sh that
          caused some systems, eg. OS X, to produce invalid
          configure scripts.
          
2012-02-23  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Removed all but one call to pthread_exit. At least 
          one has been identified to cause C++ runtime crashes 
          on some systems due to the forced unwind.

        * Updated xattr functions to return ENODATA for files
          residing inside RAR archives.

        * Fixed an issue with '--seek-length' not taking effect
          when mounting single archives. This resulted in some
          increased system load at mount time.

        * Fixed a misuse of errno that could result in false
          read errors for files in compressed RAR archives.
 
        * Fixed an issue during scanning of directories causing
          unnecessary calls to cache invalidate.

        * Fixed a warning about unused variable if REG_PC is
          not defined.

        * Updated the check for '-Wno-unused-result' support
          by the compiler. It did not work as expected.

2012-02-02  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>
  
        * Released 1.14.0

        * Built against UnRAR source v4.1.4

2012-01-29  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a bug when caching path name for folders inside
          RAR archives for which the root folder entry is not
          present in the file header.

2012-01-12  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed yet another build problem on OS X due to 
          additional argument required for Fuse4x

2012-01-11  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a problem with xattr functions taking additional
          arguments like on Darwin

2012-01-11  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Implemented getxattr() and listxattr()

        * Fixed build errors on OpenSolaris

        * Fixed issue with fdatasync() missing on some platforms

2012-01-10  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a bug introduced in previous version resulting
          in some options did not take effect

2012-01-09  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Corrected a minor options database problem

2012-01-09  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a crash when reading options with optional
          arguments.

2012-01-09  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed an issue that caused the option '--no-smp' to
          generate an error message if executing on a single CPU
          machine. Bind should now be done to the correct CPU.

        * Reworked argument parsing to work similar to native
          fuse options. This will solve the problem reported
          in issue #8.

2012-01-04  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added yet another case that was not covered at read
          of compressed archives that could result in corrupt
          data. Very unlikely though.

        * Added -DNDEBUG to CPPFLAGS for non-debug builds 
          
2011-12-28  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fall-back to direct I/O mode only if legit data can not
          be returned when reading compressed/encrypted archives. 

        * Added new experimental feature to force creation of .r2i
          files. Restricted to AVI 1.0 and non multi-part AVI 2.0 
          files only. Use --save-eof to enable this feature.

2011-12-21  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Setting seek depth to 1 by default

        * Now closing pipe(s) _after_ terminating reader thread to 
          avoid a bad file descriptor error on write.

        * Some additional code re-structuring.

2011-12-20  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Removed the pre-mature checks for EOF to avoid some
          theoretical short byte item counts.
       
        * Enabled the 'direct_io' flag for compressed/encrypted
          data streams to work around some file system cache
          issues.

        * Fixed a bug from previous version that could cause
          rarf2s to crash at file release due to an invalid
          thread handle.

2011-12-14  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Split of some large functions

        * Removed some redundant code 

        * Added missing definitions of compression method to unrar
          source extension

2011-12-13  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added global flag to indicate if file system as been shutdown
          so that running threads can terminate nicely.

        * Added a mutex to allow for early termination of reader thread
          in combination with forward jumps.

2011-12-12  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a crash (SEGV) if fuse_setup() failed

        * Changed actions when reader thread is interrupted by a
          signal to avoid a zombie.

        * Changed work around when reading far beyond current 
          offset for compressed archives.

2011-12-09  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Discarded previous optimization. 

2011-12-09  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Removed some unnecessary calls to retrieve volume number
          reducing folder load time.

        * Fixed an issue with password lookup for .rNN style volumes.

2011-12-07  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a problem with fake ISO extension for image files not inside
          an archive. This bug should only affect versions after 1.13.3.

        * Due to the above bugfix a change has been made to how image
          files, listed as a fake ISO extension, are handled when not
          located inside an archive. See rar2fs(1) man page for details.

2011-12-05  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added test for existence of member 'st_gen' in 'struct stat'.

2011-11-22  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Disabled some obsolete arguments; rar2fs(1) man page updated
          accordingly.

        * New file(s): dirlist.h

2011-11-10  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Replaced call to pthread_cancel() with pthread_kill()
          for a more graceful termination of the fuse loop thread.

        * Built against UnRAR source v4.1.3

2011-11-09  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Split of fuse_main() to run fuse_loop() in a separate thread.

2011-11-07  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Corrected an issue with Mac OS X getting stuck on
          pthread_exit(NULL) causing rar2fs to hang forever
          at unmount.

2011-11-06  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed incorrect lookup of libfuse4x.dylib in Makefile.mk

        * Added HAVE_STDBOOL_H to compat.h

        * Relaxed autoconf version requirement to 2.61 for platforms
          such as Mac OS X with XCode4.

        * Fixed Mac OS X build problems.

2011-10-28  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added missing include of inttypes.h/stdint.h in platform.h

2011-10-28  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Replaced F_LOCK with F_TLOCK in call to lockf()

        * Added checks for lockf()/flock() and fixed a problem
          with $enableval in configure.ac

        * New file(s): debug.h, index.h, platform.h
          Deleted file(s): common.h

2011-10-26  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added GNU Autotools build support. To build using the old method
          update config.mk and do 'make -f Makefile.mk'.

2011-09-28  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a problem seen in previous version when loading file
          properties over a Samba/CIFS export. Now using 1 for store
          mode etc.

2011-09-28  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Using the st_nlink (hard link count) field in stat(2) structure
          to reveal current compression method. A 0 indicates store mode
          (-m0) upto a 6 (-m6) being best compression.

2011-09-25  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added support for symbolic links. Note that this update only
          affects the back-end file system and not files inside RAR
          archives for which symbolic links currently remain unsupported.

        * Minor code clean-up and improvements.

2011-09-23  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a compilation warning about wcsncpy() being called with
          length bigger than size of destination buffer when __wcsncpy_chk_warn
          is defined.

        * Corrected a problem when 'regular file' type was not set in the
          archive according to the Linux definition of S_IFREG.
          This caused an I/O error when trying to access the file.
          Note that files of type other than S_IFREG or S_IFDIR is
          not supported by rar2fs.

        * Changed default permission to 0777 and 0666 for directories
          and regular files respectively. The default permission is
          applied only if the archive file header does not provide a
          Unix-style file mode. To change the file mode for _all_ files
          use the 'umask' FUSE option.

2011-08-28  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Ported to OpenSolaris (i386 snv_126 baseline).

        * Corrected build problem when FUSE_SRC was not set in config.mk.

2011-08-21  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed compilation warning about incompatible pointer type
          passed to scandir(3) for FreeBSD 8.0+ and later.

2011-07-24  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Released 1.13.0

2011-07-23  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * All dynamic settings are now accessed through the data base
          including source and destination path.

2011-05-30  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added missing support for FUSE 'statfs' callback reported in
          issue #5. It was required to avoid a crash (signal 8) in afpd
          when rar2fs was mounted across a Netatalk/AFP network.
          There are however still issues with getting Netatalk to work
          as expected.

2011-05-29  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Got rid of some integer to pointer conversion warnings for
          64-bit platforms reported in issue #3.

        * Fixed broken build for FreeBSD and non x86 based Linux platforms
          reported in issue #2 and #3.

2011-05-27  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * The code has been adapted to utilize the unrar API as intended
          for extraction of compressed/encrypted archives.
          This will remove the need for some of the previously added API
          extensions and will reduce the dependency to what version of
          the UnRAR source is used. However, this will instead inflict
          some extra memory overhead added by the original API callback
          interface.

        * Code clean up.

        * Corrected a problem with extraction of compressed/encrypted
          archives that could fail if the same file is opened during the
          extraction process.

2011-05-17  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Released 1.12.0

2011-05-12  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Corrected some more malloc() calls that could fail and
          pass unnoticed.

        * Option --hist-size now ranges from 0-75. Use a value of 0 to
          turn this function off. Man page updated accordingly.

2011-05-12  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added option --iob-size that can be used to tune the total
          size of the I/O buffer. Default size is 4MiB.
          It is also possible to keep the old hard-coded buffer and
          history size using the -DUSE_STATIC_IOB_ flag.

        * Added some missing checks for memory allocation failures
          during open() calls.

2011-05-11  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added option --hist-size that can be used to tune the I/O
          buffer history size. The history can be set as a percentage
          (25-75) of the total buffer size. Default is half the size of
          the total buffer, currently 2MiB.

        * Reinserted check of .avi and .mkv before attempting an index
          pre-load. This update some how got lost on the way.

2011-05-08  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Should now work also on 64-bit platforms.

        * Corrected an issue with dirname(3) usage that caused very
          strange behavior depending on what platform was used.

2011-05-07  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Corrected a build problem in previous release.

2011-05-07  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * More minor bugs in write support fixed.

        * Added support for rename(), eg. 'mv' (move).

2011-05-06  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Corrected some early "flaws" in the write support.

        * Added support for chmod() and chown().

2011-05-06  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added some very basic write support to underlying file system.
          Very experimental.

2011-05-05  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added support for mounting single RAR archives.

2011-05-04  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Improved logic in the volume part parser(s) to handle
          unlimited (in theory) number of volume files for old
          style .rNN format.

2011-05-02  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Resolved some compilation warnings in mkr2i.c that was
          discovered when building on Ubuntu 10.10.

        * Files on the local/native file system are no longer added
          to the cache. This means any changes to file system should
          now propagate properly also to the FUSE mount point.

        * Picking up UID and GID from the calling process when setting
          up stat(2) information for files inside a RAR archives.
          Unless the FUSE options 'uid' and 'gid' where used, owner and
          group were always set to 0 (root).

        * Fixed a crash when invalidating an empty cache entry.

2011-04-29  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added check to validate that source (root) and target folder
          (mount point) are in fact directories. This check will be
          relaxed for the source folder once support for mounting of
          individual RAR archives is added.

        * Several Mac OS X and FreeBSD build issues corrected.

        * Added check that file is of type .avi or .mkv before
          attempting an index pre-load.

        * Build now forces C99. Also added -Wall to identify and
          resolve a lot of warnings.

2011-04-27  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added missing display of "." and ".." for folders
          inside RAR archives.

        * Using tmp file for extraction of "rar inside rar" if glibc
          custom stream support is missing. This will provide support
          for "rar inside rar" even if the encapsulating file is
          compressed and/or encrypted. It might however perform a bit
          slow in some cases compared to using glibc custom streams.

        * FreeBSD port

2011-04-22  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added option --no-lib-check

2011-04-22  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Code updated to support Mac OS X and MacFUSE.
          Note that this is still very experimental and only tested on
          one platform. Please report back any issues you find.

        * Fixed an issue with folders inside a RAR file that did not
          show up if the root folder was not having an entry of its
          own in the file header (very rare).

2011-04-15  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added version.h

2011-04-14  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * New revisioning approach using Major.Minor.PatchLevel instead
          of Major.Minor beta releases.
          Stable releases will be denoted by a patch level of 0.
          Each stable release will then be archived using a compressed
          tarball and committed to the project home page download section.

        * Minor code/Makefile updates.

2011-04-07  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed broken build for platforms not having the cpu_set_t
          type in sched.h (GNU extension).

2011-03-20  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Built against UnRAR source v4.0.7

        * Minor modification of backward jump (history) logic for
          compressed/encrypted archives.

2011-02-15  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Released 1.08

2011-02-09  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a crash (SEGV) issue if some volume files were missing.

2011-02-03  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        *  Added new option --img-type.

        * Changed option --fake-iso to now accept a list of file
          extensions/types as argument instead of having only hard-coded
          values of ".img" and ".nrg".

2011-01-27  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Replaced the --no-filter option with --exclude.
          See manual page for details on how to use this new option.
          Be aware that due to this change .lock files are no longer
          filtered out by default.

2011-01-25  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Fixed a bug in handling of WAIT_THREAD() that could result
          in that data was not read properly in SMP mode.

        * Added the option --no-smp to turn off SMP support and bind
          process(s) to CPU #0 (Linux only).

2011-01-22  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Added HAS_GLIBC_CUSTOM_STREAMS_ to control the use of this GNU
          extensions in glibc. This became necessary since many uClibc
          distributions choose not to provide glibc custom stream support.
          Turning this feature off disables the support for "rar inside rar"
          if the encapsulating file is compressed and/or encrypted.

2011-01-17  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Released 1.07

2011-01-14  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * Built against UnRAR source v4.0 beta 4

        * Added a sliding window to the IO buffer to allow for at least
          some sort of backward read support.
          The window is currently hard-coded to half the I/O buffer size
          (4/2 = 2MiB) and for that reason the I/O buffer size had to be
          increased from 2MiB to 4MiB.

        * Fixed permissions to now be handled by kernel instead.

        * Added limited support for "rar inside rar".
          Main archive or encapsulated RAR file must not be a volume
          (i.e. must be monolithic).
          Only one (1) level of depth is supported (--seek-depth > 0).
          Extracted file can be of any shape or form except for password
          protection which is currently not supported (inherits main
          archive password).

        * Use of external unrar program no longer required.
          Can still be chosen instead of internal routines using the
          --unrar-path option.

        * Minor memory leak fixed when parsing folders inside archives.

        * Added support for password protected archives
          (raw read mode not yet supported).

        * Some stability issues corrected.

        * Fixed an off-by-one bug (!?) in date/time hour calculation.

        * Changed 'blocks' calculation as returned by stat()

        * Fixed some memory leaks in cache collision chain

        * Replaced the "Unique RAR File Library" (by Christian Scheurer)
          with the more complete "Unrar C++ Library" (by Alexander Roshal)
          and some extensions to it.

        * Minor source code clean up. Still lots left to do.

2010-05-23  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * First release candidate(s) only published at opentvix.org and
          xtreamer.net (no source)

2009-09-06  Hans Beckerus <hans.beckerus#AT#gmail.com>

        * First version
